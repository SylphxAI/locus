# @sylphx/locus-darwin-x64

## 0.6.2

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 1d37704: Ship `locus-cli` alongside `locus-mcp-server` in multi-arch platform optionalDependency packages so clean npm install can complete `tools/call codebase_search` without a monorepo Rust build. cli_bridge resolves sibling CLI next to the MCP native binary.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 3695510: Ship multi-arch native MCP binaries via optionalDependencies platform packages (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64-gnu, linux-arm64-gnu). Arch-aware bin wrapper fails closed on wrong-arch or missing native; no TS fallback.
